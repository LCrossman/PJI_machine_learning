Machine Learning for non-aureus Staphylococci in biofilming in Prosthetic joint infection

I generated this code in 2017 for a specific research project on staphylococcal genomes which had an non-disclosure agreement.
The agreement has since expired and the research is published in bioRXiv [https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.01.582901](here)

The code is provided as was in 2017 (for the purposes of the research paper), which required python 2.7, sklearn 0.18.1 or sklearn 0.18.2 plus numpy 0.13
<br>In the research, several alternative options were tried, including separate classification and regression strategies and various Boost methods.
The code includes the classification methods used in the final analyses whilst the regression methods that were used are commented out.
